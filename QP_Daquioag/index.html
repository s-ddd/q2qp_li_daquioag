                <p>
                    Born officially in 1947, but with roots that traces 
                    back to the revolutionary days, the Philippine Red 
                    Cross has truly become the premier humanitarian 
                    organization in the country, committed to provide 
                    quality life-saving services that protect the life 
                    and dignity especially of indigent Filipinos in 
                    vulnerable situations.

                <p>
                    In all its 74 years of reputable existence, the 
                    Philippine Red Cross has lived through many changes 
                    that were intended to help more people. Where it used 
                    to be involved only in providing blood and in 
                    disaster-related activities, the Philippine Red Cross 
                    now focuses on a holistic approach to uplift the 
                    condition of the most vulnerable. Where it used to 
                    offer short-term palliatives, it now offers a wider 
                    array of humanitarian services ranging from preventive 
                    medicine to therapeutic counseling, to youth leadership.
